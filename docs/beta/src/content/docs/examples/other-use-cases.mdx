<Carbon />

Although primarily designed for handling class names, at its core, `cva` is really just a fancy way of managing a string…

## Dynamic Text Content

```ts
const greeter = cva("Good morning!", {
  variants: {
    isLoggedIn: {
      true: "Here's a secret only logged in users can see",
      false: "Log in to find out more…",
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    isLoggedIn: "false",
  },
});

greeter();
// => "Good morning! Log in to find out more…"

greeter({ isLoggedIn: "true" });
// => "Good morning! Here's a secret only logged in users can see"
```
